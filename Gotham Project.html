        The city streets are crowded for the holiday. Even with the rain. Hidden in the chaos is the element,
        waiting to
        strike like snakes. And I'm there too. Watching. 2 years of nights have turned me into a nocturnal animal.
        I
        must choose my targets carefully. It's a big city. I can't be everywhere. But they don't know where I am.
        We
        have a signal now, for when I'm needed. When that light hits the sky, it's not just a call- it's a warning.
        To
        them. <b><i>Fear is a tool.</i></b> They think I'm hiding in the shadows. But I AM the shadows. I wish I could
        say
        I'm making
        a difference, but I don't know. Murder, robberies, assault- 2 years later, they're all up. And now this. This
        city's eating itself. Maybe it can't be saved, but i have to try. <b>PUSH MYSELF.</b> These nights all roll
        together in
        a rush, Behind the mask. Sometimes in the morning i have to force myself to remember everything that
        happened.
