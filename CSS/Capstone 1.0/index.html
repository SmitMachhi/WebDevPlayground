                <p class="main-text">Everysince I discovered the first computer (thanks to my brother) I was facinated
                    with
                    the
                    idea of having
                    unlimited possibilites on a screen. Then I discovered the Zukerberg story which lead me to pursue
                    career
                    in
                    computer engineering. But I'm at the level that I hoped I'd be with programming and engineering so
                    I've
                    started from fundamentals of programming and I challenged myself to land a developer job in upcoming
                    6
                    months (today is august 7, 2023).

                <p class="main-text">Music has always been something I've been interested in, I also wanted to create
                    immersive musical experience like Hans Zimmer and Ludwig Goransson. Then I discovered the duo of
                    Billie
                    Eilish and Finieas and I was also fortunate enough to have super talented sister like Billie growing
                    up,
                    Although I am no way near the level of Finieas I really want to make music with my sister Mishwa and
                    express my self through this incredible artform.

                <p class="main-text">My brother Piyu who gave me the most valuable gift of my life "The gift of
                    Curiosity". Along with computers he also introduced me to the world of amazing stories like The
                    Batman
                    Triology, Prince of Persia, Inception, Spiderman, Tombraider, God of War etc. this videogames and
                    movies
                    are preety much foundation of I am who I am today. Me an my brother used to go on long walks and
                    talk
                    about films we can make, stories we can right etc. Despite, our huge ideas we never actually were
                    able
                    to make somethinghappen due to our lack of time together but I for sure that in upcoming years there
                    is
                    a future where we are finally able to pursue what we've always been facinated about.
